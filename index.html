								<h2>About Us</h2>
								<p>The Thandriyaar family has a long-standing history rooted in tradition and community. From generations, we have lived in the serene village of Nesal, near Pondicherry, where our ancestors toiled tirelessly as farmers. Despite the challenges posed by the harsh climate and erratic rainfall, they persevered to provide for their children, instilling in them the values of hard work and resilience.</p>
								<p>Over the years, many in our family transitioned from farming to becoming small traders, selling chillies, mustard, and other commodities. A few ventured into gunny bag trading, laying the foundation for our family's economic growth. Today, we are proud to see our descendants flourishing as educated professionals, government employees, and successful business owners, leading a life of comfort and luxury.</p>
								<p>We celebrate our rich heritage and the spirit of unity that binds us together. Join us in honoring our legacy and the journey that has shaped the Thandriyaar family.</p>

							<h2>Our Journey</h2>
              <p>Our journey is a testament to the strength and determination of the Thandriyaar family. From humble beginnings as farmers, we faced numerous challenges, including droughts and financial hardships. However, our ancestors' unwavering spirit led them to adapt and explore new avenues for livelihood.</p>
              <p>Throughout these struggles, our ancestors placed immense importance on the education and well-being of their children. They believed that knowledge was the key to a better future, and despite their hardships, they ensured that their children received a good education. This dedication has borne fruit, as today, the newer generations are well-educated and thriving in various fields, including software and multinational corporations.</p>
              <p>Many of our family members now travel abroad frequently, embracing opportunities that were once a distant dream. As we reflect on our past, we honor the sacrifices made by our ancestors and celebrate the successes of our present, remaining committed to nurturing the values that have guided us through generations.</p>
